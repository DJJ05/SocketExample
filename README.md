# SocketExample
A very, very basic Python sockets example using headers, to simulate a direct chat between a host server and client(s) on the same network.

The SERVER global needs to be changed in both files to your local IPv4 address, and the PORT global can be changed if you wish.
It is set to 8999 by default, which is an unused port.
